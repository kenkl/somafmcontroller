#  SomaFM Controller

A companion to my [somafmplayer](https://github.com/kenkl/somafmplayer) project...

[somafmplayer](https://github.com/kenkl/somafmplayer) is a little Flask shim that drives mplayer to play a stream from the [SomaFM](https://somafm.com/) online radio (commercial-free, independent, listener-supported) station. 

This project is a simple TKinter application used to select/play a stream on the player. It pulls a list of available streams from [somafmplayer](https://github.com/kenkl/somafmplayer), and presents them in the drop-down list. Select one, hit 'PLAY'. Simple.
